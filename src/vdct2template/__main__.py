    ### VDCT to template conversion function.

    - This function assumes that all referenced VDCT files in the expand() blocks
    will be in the same folder.

    - We can use the builder.py file to check for direct references to template files
    Use --no-use-builder to disable this feature. Direct references to a template
    file is an error because we need to modify all macro names to add a _ prefix
    in templated files.

    - Files referenced in expand() blocks will have their macro names updated to
    all have a _ prefix, because MSI does not support substituting a macro with
    it's own name and passing a default. This is a workaround to that limitation.

    - The original expands() block is replaced with a series of substitute
    MSI directives and an include MSI directive.

    - The resulting set of templates can be expanded natively by MSI without the
    need for VDCT.

    - The DB files created by such an expansion should be equivalent to the
    original VDCT generated ones.
